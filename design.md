# Soul Cards – AI Agent Design Brief
## Card Sprite Generation

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Generate 18 unique card sprites for a mobile divination/card game called **Soul Cards**. Cards are designed for an Android app. Style is minimal, abstract, and symbolic — simple enough that someone could hand-draw the designs.

## TECHNICAL SPECS

- **Resolution:** 1024 x 1536 pixels (2:3 portrait ratio)
- **Platform:** Android
- **Style:** Minimal, abstract/symbolic, TCG-style card layout
- **Total Cards:** 18 (6 suits × 3 ranks)

## CARD LAYOUT STRUCTURE

Each card follows this layout:

- **Top Left Corner** – Rank number (1, 2, or 3)
- **Center** – Large abstract/symbolic art representing the element (suit color as background)

| Earth | Brown |
| Water | Dark Blue |

## DESIGN GUIDELINES

- Symbols should be **abstract and minimal** — clean lines, not photorealistic
- The symbol should be the **visual focal point** of the card
- Bottom panel should be a distinct section with enough contrast to read the text clearly
- Rank number (top left) should be simple and legible
- Overall feel: clean, spiritual, grounded — not flashy or cluttered
- Cards should feel cohesive as a set while being clearly distinguishable by suit color

---

## NAMING

The deck is called **Soul Cards**.
